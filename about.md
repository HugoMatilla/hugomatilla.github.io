 Hi, I am Hugo and this is Sparta!... not really this is my blog.

I made some resolutions for 2016, things that I was postponing over and over. First one write them.

I am a computer science whole life student. First thing you heard in the Software Engeenireng School is:   
_"You have chossen a path that will keep you studing all your life."_

I thouhgt after University I could quit studying, but not. However I realize that one thing that I love the most is to study
so I feel lucky of choosing Computer Science as my field. :D

I studied in Madrid at [FI-UPM](https://www.fi.upm.es/), I did the Eramus Program in Berlin at [TU-Berlin](http://www.tu-berlin.de/) with a Diploma Project and an internship in the [T-Labs](https://www.net.t-labs.tu-berlin.de/talks/past_talks_2009.shtml)

I worked in Madrid in Data Warehousing at [Alamo Consulting](http://alamoconsulting.com/) and in Bussiness Intelligence projects at [Innova-TSN](http://www.innova-tsn.es/)

I sudied at home a Postgraduate in Mobile Applications Development at [Fundacion UNED](http://www.fundacion.uned.es/web).

I worked in Berlin as Android Developer at [Smart Mobile Factory](http://smartmobilefactory.com/en/) and I am currently working at [Scondoo](https://scondoo.de/)

I moved back to Spain from Berlin after travelling 2,5 months through Japan, Tahiland and [Indonesia](https://unsplash.com/photos/EFuCATqfblI). Now I work 2 days/week from home for scondoo, the rest of the time I study and try new stuff.
